| Pack                   | What You Learn                                         | When to Start                  | Exercises                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **[basics/](basics/)** | Solve real problems with Claude using natural language | After Ch3 Lesson 5 (CLAUDE.md) | 21 exercises + 3 capstones |
| **[skills/](skills/)** | Turn solutions into reusable skills and patterns       | After Ch3 Lesson 9 (Subagents) | 21 exercises + 3 capstones |

**basics/** teaches you to describe problems clearly so Claude can solve them.
**skills/** teaches you to package solutions so they work every time.

## Start Here (Recommended Minimum Path)

If you're short on time, do these 9 exercises from basics/:

1. **Module 1** — File Organization (exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
2. **Module 2** — Research & Synthesis (exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
3. **Module 3** — Data Wrangling (exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

These build the core skill: turning messy real-world problems into clear specifications.

## How to Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-exercises.git
cd claude-code-exercises/basics/module-1/exercise-1.1-messy-downloads
claude
# Read INSTRUCTIONS.md and start solving
```

### With Cowork (Desktop App)

1. Open the Claude Desktop app and switch to the Cowork tab
2. Point Cowork at the exercise folder
3. Read INSTRUCTIONS.md and describe your task to Claude

### With Claude Code (Terminal)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the exercise folder
2. Run `claude`
3. Read INSTRUCTIONS.md and start working

## What's Inside

### basics/ — Problem Solving (8 modules)

Organize files, research topics, wrangle data, create documents, automate workflows, solve problems, and verify AI output. All materials pre-made — download and start.

See [basics/README.md](basics/) for the full exercise list.

### skills/ — Reusable Problem Solving (8 modules)

Understand skills, build your first skills, add examples and references, test and iterate, compose skill pipelines, and build production-ready workflows.

See [skills/README.md](skills/) for the full exercise list.

## Problem-Solving Framework

Use this for every exercise:

1. **Define** — What exactly am I trying to accomplish?
2. **Gather** — What files/data does Claude need?
3. **Specify** — Describe the desired outcome, constraints, and format
4. **Execute** — Run it with Claude Code or Cowork
5. **Verify** — Does the output match what I asked for?
6. **Iterate** — What would I change? Run it again.
7. **Reflect** — What did I learn about specifying problems clearly?
