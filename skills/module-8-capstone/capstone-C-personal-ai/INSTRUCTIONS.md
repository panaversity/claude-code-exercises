# Capstone C — Personal AI Productivity Skill Set

## The Mission
Build a personalized skill set that automates YOUR most time-consuming recurring tasks.

## Step 1: Audit Your Week
For one week (or think back over the past month), track:
- What tasks do you do repeatedly?
- What takes longer than it should?
- What do you wish "just worked" every time?
- What requires you to re-explain the same things to AI?

List at least 10 tasks.

## Step 2: Prioritize
From your list, select the TOP 5 tasks based on:
- Frequency (how often do you do it?)
- Time cost (how long does it take?)
- Consistency need (does it need to be the same every time?)
- Skill potential (would a SKILL.md actually help?)

## Step 3: Build 5 Skills
For each of the 5 tasks, build a complete skill:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── README.md
├── examples/ (if applicable)
├── templates/ (if applicable)
└── references/ (if applicable)
```

## Step 4: Test Each Skill
- Run at least 3 test cases per skill
- Document results and iterate

## Step 5: Build a Personal Library
Create a `my-skills/LIBRARY.md` that indexes all 5 skills.

## Step 6: Measure the Impact
For each skill, estimate:
- Time before skill: X minutes per occurrence
- Time with skill: Y minutes per occurrence
- Weekly occurrences: N
- **Weekly time saved: N × (X - Y) minutes**

## Deliverable
A complete personal skill library with documentation, tests, and impact measurements.

## What Makes This Capstone Special
Unlike A and B, this capstone is about YOUR real life. The skills you build here are ones you'll actually use. This is where the course stops being academic and becomes genuinely useful.
