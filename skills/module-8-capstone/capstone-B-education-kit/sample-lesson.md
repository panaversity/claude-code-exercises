# Sample Lesson: "Writing Your First Specification"

## Metadata
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **Target Audience:** Beginners
- **Pillars Covered:** 1 (Problem Decomposition), 2 (Specification Writing)
- **Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with Claude or ChatGPT

## Learning Objectives
1. Convert a vague project idea into 3 specific tasks
2. Write a specification for one task that includes inputs, outputs, and success criteria
3. Test the spec by giving it to Claude and evaluating the output

## Lesson Flow
### Introduction (10 min)
Show two prompts: "Build me a website" vs. a detailed spec. Show the wildly different outputs.

### Demonstration (20 min)
Live-code a spec from scratch: Start with "I want a budget tracker" and decompose + specify step by step.

### Guided Practice (25 min)
Students pick from 3 project ideas and write specs. Instructor circulates and gives feedback.

### Independent Practice (25 min)
Students test their specs with Claude and evaluate: did the output match their expectations?

### Wrap-Up (10 min)
3 students share: What did you spec vs. what did Claude produce? What was the gap?

## Assessment
Students submit their spec + Claude's output + a 3-sentence reflection on what they'd change.
