# Capstone B — AI-Native Education Skill Kit

## The Mission
Build a set of skills that power an AI-native course delivery system. These skills help instructors create, deliver, and assess course content consistently.

## Required Skills (Build All 6)

### 1. Lesson Plan Generator
Takes a topic + learning objectives and produces a structured lesson plan aligned with the Seven Pillars framework. Must reference the pillars document.

### 2. Exercise Builder
Takes a learning objective and generates a hands-on exercise with: setup instructions, sample data, step-by-step tasks, and evaluation criteria.

### 3. Quiz Generator
Takes lesson content and generates a quiz: 5 multiple choice + 3 short answer questions, with answer key and explanation for each.

### 4. Student Feedback Writer
Takes a student's submission details and generates personalized feedback in the ideal tone (warm, specific, honest). Must reference tone examples.

### 5. Curriculum Alignment Checker
Takes a set of lesson plans and checks coverage of all Seven Pillars. Produces an alignment matrix and gap analysis.

### 6. Course Packager
Orchestrates: Lesson Plan → Exercise → Quiz for each topic, then runs the Alignment Checker across all lessons.
