# NovaTech Brand Voice & Style Guide

## Who We Are
NovaTech builds developer tools that make complex infrastructure simple. Our customers are senior engineers and CTOs who are tired of overengineered solutions.

## Our Voice

### Personality Traits
1. **Direct** — We say what we mean. No corporate fluff, no marketing buzzwords.
2. **Confident** — We know our product is good. We don't hedge or apologize.
3. **Technical but accessible** — We respect our audience's intelligence but don't gatekeep.
4. **Slightly informal** — We're a product company, not a bank. First-person is fine.

### Tone Spectrum
- Blog posts: Conversational, like explaining to a smart colleague over coffee
- Documentation: Clear and precise, no personality needed
- Marketing: Confident but not aggressive, show don't tell
- Social media: Casual, witty when appropriate, never try-hard

### Words We Use
- "Simple" not "easy" (simple respects complexity, easy dismisses it)
- "Developers" not "users" (they're professionals, not consumers)
- "Ship" not "deploy" (more human, less corporate)
- "Fix" not "resolve" (direct)
- "We" not "NovaTech" in most contexts (more personal)

### Words We NEVER Use
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" / "Cutting-edge" (overused, means nothing)
- "Leverage" / "Utilize" / "Synergy" (corporate speak)
- "Simply" as in "simply do X" (if it were simple, they wouldn't need instructions)
- "Excited to announce" (everyone says this, it's noise)
- "Solution" as a standalone noun ("our solution" → "our tool" or name it specifically)

### Formatting Principles
- Sentences: Short to medium. Max 25 words for marketing, flexible for docs.
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences. No walls of text.
- Headlines: Specific over clever. "Deploy in 30 seconds" beats "The Future of Deployment."
- Bullet points: Use for lists of 3+. Use sentences for 1-2 items.
- Code examples: Always include one in technical blog posts.

### Examples

**Good blog opening:**
"We shipped a new feature last week that cuts deployment time by 60%. Here's what we changed and why."

**Bad blog opening:**
"We're excited to announce a revolutionary new feature that will transform the way you think about deployment! In today's fast-paced world of software development, speed is everything."

**Good documentation:**
"Install the CLI: `npm install -g novatech-cli`. Run `nova init` to create a new project."

**Bad documentation:**
"To begin your NovaTech journey, you'll first want to install our powerful command-line interface tool, which will serve as your gateway to the NovaTech ecosystem."
