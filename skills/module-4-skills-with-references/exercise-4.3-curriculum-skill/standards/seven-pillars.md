# The Seven Pillars of AI-Driven Development

## Overview
These seven pillars define what a competent AI-native developer must master. Every course, lesson, and exercise should map to one or more pillars.

## Pillar 1: Problem Decomposition
The ability to break a vague goal into clear, specific, actionable tasks that an AI agent can execute. This is the foundational skill — without it, nothing else works.

**What it looks like:** A student can take "build me a dashboard" and decompose it into 15 specific, sequenced tasks with clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria.

## Pillar 2: Specification Writing
The ability to describe desired outcomes with enough precision that an AI agent produces correct results consistently. This includes defining inputs, outputs, constraints, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.

**What it looks like:** A student writes a spec that two different AI models would interpret the same way.

## Pillar 3: Context Engineering
The ability to provide AI agents with the right background information, examples, and reference material to produce excellent output. This replaces "prompt engineering" as the core skill.

**What it looks like:** A student knows when to provide examples, when to provide reference docs, and how much context is too much.

## Pillar 4: Quality Verification
The ability to evaluate AI output critically — checking for correctness, completeness, consistency, and fitness for purpose. This is the human's essential role in the AI workflow.

**What it looks like:** A student can identify 5 types of errors in AI output: factual, logical, stylistic, structural, and omission.

## Pillar 5: Iterative Refinement
The ability to improve AI output through specific, constructive feedback cycles. Not just "make it better" but precise identification of what to change and why.

**What it looks like:** A student can take a mediocre AI output and improve it to production quality in 3 or fewer feedback rounds.

## Pillar 6: Tool Orchestration
The ability to select, configure, and combine AI tools for specific tasks. This includes understanding when to use which tool, how to chain tools together, and how to build reusable workflows (skills).

**What it looks like:** A student can build a multi-step workflow using Claude Code, Cowork, or similar tools to automate a real business process.

## Pillar 7: Responsible AI Practice
The ability to use AI tools ethically and safely — including fact-checking, bias awareness, privacy protection, and knowing when human judgment must override AI output.

**What it looks like:** A student proactively identifies risks in AI-generated content and knows when to escalate to human review.
