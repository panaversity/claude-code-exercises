# How Our Team Uses AI to Ship Faster

*This content was created with AI assistance and reviewed by the engineering team.*

Over the past quarter, our development team has integrated AI coding assistants into our daily workflow. The results have been encouraging: our internal surveys show developers report saving approximately 2 hours per day on routine coding tasks.

"We started by using AI for boilerplate code generation," says the engineering lead. "Now we're using it for code review assistance and documentation." [Quote verified with engineering lead]

We want to be transparent: AI tools aren't perfect. They occasionally suggest outdated patterns or miss edge cases. That's why every AI-assisted code change goes through our standard code review process before merging.

The team continues to evaluate which tasks benefit most from AI assistance, and we'll share more learnings as our practice matures.
