# Exercise 6.3 — Team Skills: Building for Others

## Goal
Build a set of skills for a team workflow, where different roles use different skills that work together.

## The Scenario
You're setting up AI skills for a 5-person design agency (use the Pixel Perfect Design Studio scenario from the previous exercise pack, or use the brief below).

## The Team
- **Creative Director** — Reviews work, sets direction, communicates with clients
- **Senior Designer** — Creates designs, presents options, iterates based on feedback
- **Junior Designer** — Supports senior designers, creates variations, maintains assets
- **Project Manager** — Tracks tasks, sends updates, manages timelines
- **Admin** — Handles invoicing, scheduling, client communications

## Your Task
Build ONE skill for each role (5 skills total):

1. **Creative Brief Skill** — Helps the Creative Director write structured creative briefs for designers
2. **Design Feedback Skill** — Helps the Senior Designer write constructive feedback on design reviews
3. **Asset Checklist Skill** — Helps the Junior Designer verify that all deliverable assets are complete and properly named
4. **Status Update Skill** — Helps the PM generate weekly status updates from task data
5. **Client Invoice Skill** — Helps Admin generate consistent, professional invoices

## Quality Bar
- Each skill should be usable by someone who's never seen it before
- Skills should use consistent terminology (same project names, same team names)
- Skills should cross-reference each other where relevant (e.g., the invoice skill references project names from the status update skill)
