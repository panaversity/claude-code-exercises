Sprint Review — Feb 19, 2025, 3:00 PM
Attendees: Ali, Sara, Ahmed, Fatima, Omar

sara demoed the new search feature. search results now return in under 200ms (was 800ms). team applauded.

ahmed showed the redesigned settings page. ali liked it but suggested moving the notification preferences to a more prominent position. ahmed agreed and will update by friday.

fatima presented the Q1 marketing metrics:
- blog traffic up 40% quarter over quarter
- 3 posts went "mini-viral" on LinkedIn (>10K impressions each)
- email open rates steady at 32%

discussion about the upcoming product launch (march 15):
- sara: engineering is ready, all critical bugs fixed
- ahmed: design assets done, just needs final copy from fatima
- fatima: launch blog post drafted, needs review from ali
- omar: sales enablement materials needed by march 5

ali raised concern about documentation — it's outdated. nobody's updated the API docs since november. sara said she'll assign someone but it's low priority compared to the launch.

random sidebar about the office snack situation. ali will order new snacks.

decisions:
1. launch stays on march 15
2. documentation update deferred to post-launch sprint
3. weekly launch readiness check-ins starting next week
