# Exercise 7.2 — Production Skill: Content Creation Pipeline

## Goal
Build a skill that takes a topic and produces a complete content package: blog post draft, social media posts, and an email newsletter blurb — all consistent in message but adapted to each channel.

## The Skill Must Handle
1. **Input:** A topic brief (subject, key points, target audience, CTA)
2. **Output:**
   - Blog post (600-800 words, with heading structure)
   - 3 LinkedIn posts (different angles on the same topic)
   - 1 Twitter/X thread (5-7 tweets)
   - Email newsletter blurb (100 words max)
3. **Consistency:** All outputs must convey the same core message
4. **Adaptation:** Each channel has different length, tone, and formatting rules

## Provided Materials
- `content-briefs/` — 3 content briefs to test with
- `channel-guidelines.md` — Formatting rules for each channel
- `anti-examples.md` — Examples of BAD content to avoid

## Build It
Create `content-pipeline-skill/` with full skill structure.
Test on all 3 briefs. Verify cross-channel consistency.
