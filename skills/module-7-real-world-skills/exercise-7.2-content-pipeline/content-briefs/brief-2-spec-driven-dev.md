# Content Brief: Spec-Driven Development

**Topic:** Why writing specifications before asking AI to build is the most important skill of 2025

**Key Points:**
- Most people start with "build me X" — the best results start with "here's exactly what X should do"
- Specs serve triple duty: instructions for AI, documentation for humans, test criteria for QA
- Even non-developers benefit from spec-writing skills
- Data: Teams using spec-driven approaches report 3x fewer revision cycles

**Target Audience:** Developers and technical managers transitioning to AI-assisted workflows
