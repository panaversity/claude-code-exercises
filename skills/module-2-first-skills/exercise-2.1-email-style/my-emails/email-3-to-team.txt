Subject: New initiative — please read

Hi team,

Wanted to share something exciting. We're launching a new AI-native development track starting next month, and I need your help shaping it.

Here's what I'm thinking:
- 5-module course focused on Claude Code and Cowork
- Target audience: developers transitioning to AI-driven workflows
- Format: hands-on exercises with real projects, not lectures

I've attached a rough outline. Would love your feedback by Friday — especially on:
1. Are the exercise topics relevant to what students actually struggle with?
2. Is the progression logical?
3. What's missing?

Don't hold back — candid feedback is exactly what I need right now.

Thanks everyone,
Zia
