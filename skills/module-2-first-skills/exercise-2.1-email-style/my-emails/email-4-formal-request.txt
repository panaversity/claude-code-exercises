Subject: Partnership Inquiry — Panaversity x TechEd Global

Dear Dr. Hassan,

I'm writing to introduce Panaversity and explore a potential partnership with TechEd Global. We're building Pakistan's leading AI-native education platform, currently serving over 16,000 learners through PIAIC.

Our programs focus on practical, hands-on AI development — teaching students to build real products using tools like Claude Code, OpenAI's agent frameworks, and cloud-native deployment platforms.

I believe there's a strong alignment between our practical approach and TechEd Global's reach in the South Asian education market. Specifically, I'd love to explore:

1. Co-developing AI curriculum for your existing programs
2. Joint certification that carries both organizations' credibility
3. Shared access to our interactive learning platform

Would you be open to a 30-minute call next week to discuss? I'm available Tuesday through Thursday, any time between 10 AM and 4 PM PKT.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
Zia Khan
CEO, Panaversity | COO, PIAIC
