Subject: Project Update — Week of January 27

Dear Zara,

Thank you for your patience as we worked through the integration challenges this week. I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand.

We've completed the authentication module and it's now in testing. The dashboard components are about 70% done, and we're on track to deliver the demo by February 14 as planned.

One item to flag: we discovered that your CRM system uses a non-standard API format. Our team is adapting to it, but it may add 2-3 days to the timeline. I'll confirm the impact by end of week.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to schedule a call to discuss.

Best regards,
Zia Khan
CEO, Panaversity
