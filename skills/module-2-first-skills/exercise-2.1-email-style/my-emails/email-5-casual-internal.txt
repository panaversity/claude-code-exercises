Subject: Re: Friday demo

Omar — that demo was 🔥

Seriously though, three things that stood out:
1. The spec-driven workflow was so clean. Students are going to love this.
2. The error handling was actually graceful (rare!)
3. The way you integrated the quiz system into the reading flow — chef's kiss.

One small thing: the loading time on module 3 felt a bit slow. Maybe we can lazy-load the quiz components? Not urgent, just noting it.

Let's celebrate at lunch today. My treat.
