# Professional Greeting Generator

## When to Use
- User asks for a greeting, welcome message, or icebreaker
- User is writing an email or message opening
- User needs to introduce themselves or their team

## Instructions

1. Ask (or infer from context) the **channel**: email, Slack, meeting, or presentation
2. Ask (or infer) the **relationship**: first contact, existing colleague, manager, client, or external partner
3. Ask (or infer) the **tone**: formal, friendly-professional, or casual

### Generate the greeting following these rules:

**Email Greetings:**
- First contact: "Dear [Name]," + one sentence of context for why you're reaching out
- Existing colleague: "Hi [Name]," + one warm sentence (reference a recent interaction if possible)
- Client/external: "Dear [Name]," + one sentence acknowledging the relationship

**Slack Messages:**
- Always start with "Hey [Name]!" or "Hi [team/channel]!"
- Keep the opener to one line maximum
- Never use "Dear" in Slack

**Meeting Openers:**
- Start with "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone."
- Add one sentence of context: what the meeting is about
- Keep it under 30 words

## Rules
- Never use "I hope this email finds you well" — it's overused
- Never use emojis in emails to clients or first contacts
- Slack messages MAY use 1-2 emojis if the tone is casual
- Always match the formality level of the context
- If the user doesn't specify a name, use [Name] as a placeholder
