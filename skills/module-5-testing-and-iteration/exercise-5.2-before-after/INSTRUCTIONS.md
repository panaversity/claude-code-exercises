# Exercise 5.2 — Before/After: Measuring Skill Improvement

## Goal
Learn to systematically measure whether changes to a skill actually make it better.

## Method
1. Run the SAME test cases on v1 of a skill
2. Improve the skill → v2
3. Run the SAME test cases on v2
4. Score both versions on a rubric
5. Compare: Did v2 actually improve?

## Your Task

### Step 1: Baseline (v1)
Use `email-response-skill-v1/SKILL.md` to respond to all 5 customer emails in `customer-emails/`.
Score each response using the rubric in `rubric.md`. Record scores in `scorecard.md`.

### Step 2: Identify Weaknesses
Based on the scores, identify the 3 biggest weaknesses of v1.

### Step 3: Improve (v2)
Create `email-response-skill-v2/SKILL.md` that addresses those weaknesses.

### Step 4: Re-test
Run the SAME 5 emails through v2. Score again using the SAME rubric.

### Step 5: Compare
Did the scores improve? Did fixing one thing break another?
Write a comparison summary.

## Important
The rubric stays the same. The test cases stay the same. Only the skill changes. This is how you isolate the effect of your changes.
