Subject: Charged twice this month???

I just checked my credit card statement and I see TWO charges from your company this month:
- Feb 1: $49.00
- Feb 15: $49.00

I only have one account. Why was I charged twice? Please fix this immediately. If this isn't resolved by end of week I'm filing a dispute with my bank.
