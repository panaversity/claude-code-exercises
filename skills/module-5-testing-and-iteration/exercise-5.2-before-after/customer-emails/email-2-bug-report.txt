Subject: Export to PDF not working

Hi support team,

I've been trying to export my monthly report to PDF for the last 2 hours. Every time I click the export button, it gets stuck at 90% and then shows an error message that says 'Export failed: timeout.' I've tried on Chrome and Firefox, same issue.

This is blocking me from sending my report to the board, which is due tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Sara
