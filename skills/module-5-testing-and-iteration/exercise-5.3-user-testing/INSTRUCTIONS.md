# Exercise 5.3 — User Testing: Does Your Skill Work for Others?

## Goal
Test whether YOUR skill works when SOMEONE ELSE uses it — the ultimate quality check.

## The Exercise

### Step 1: Pick a Skill
Choose the best skill you've built in any previous exercise.

### Step 2: Package It
Create a folder with:
- Your SKILL.md
- Any reference files or templates
- A README explaining what the skill does and how to use it
- 3 sample test prompts

### Step 3: Swap with a Classmate
Give your skill package to a classmate. Receive theirs.

### Step 4: Test Their Skill (They Test Yours)
- Read their README
- Run their 3 test prompts
- Then create 2 NEW test prompts of your own — tasks you think the skill SHOULD handle

### Step 5: Write Feedback
For each test, score on:
1. Did the skill produce the expected output? (yes/no)
2. Was the output quality good? (1-5)
3. Was anything confusing about how to use the skill? (describe)
4. What would you improve? (specific suggestions)

### Step 6: Receive Feedback and Improve
Take your classmate's feedback and create a v2 of your skill.

## If Working Solo
If you don't have a classmate to swap with:
1. Wait 24 hours after building your skill
2. Re-read your SKILL.md as if you've never seen it
3. Run the test prompts
4. Write honest notes about what's unclear

The 24-hour gap creates enough "mental distance" to see your skill with fresh eyes.
