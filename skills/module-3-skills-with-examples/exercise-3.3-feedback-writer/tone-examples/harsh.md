# Feedback: Ahmed — Module 3 Assessment

Performance: Below expectations.

Ahmed's submission for the API integration project had multiple issues. Error handling was non-existent, and the code would crash on any unexpected input. The documentation was incomplete — several endpoints were missing descriptions entirely.

He needs to:
1. Learn proper error handling patterns immediately
2. Complete his documentation before submitting
3. Test his work more thoroughly
4. Ask for help when stuck instead of submitting incomplete work

Grade: C+

If this level of work continues, Ahmed will struggle in the advanced modules.
