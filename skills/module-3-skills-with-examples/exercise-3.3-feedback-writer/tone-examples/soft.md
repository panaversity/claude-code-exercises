# Feedback: Ahmed — Module 3 Assessment

Great effort, Ahmed! You clearly put a lot of work into this project and it really shows. The API integration is mostly working, which is a solid achievement at this stage.

A few things to think about for next time — maybe consider adding some error handling? It could help make the project even stronger. And if you get a chance, adding some documentation would be nice too.

Overall, you should feel really proud of what you've accomplished here. Keep up the good work!

Grade: B+

You're doing great! 😊
