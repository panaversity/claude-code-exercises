# Student Profile: Sara Ahmed
## Assignment: Module 3 — Web Scraper Project

## Observations

Submitted a web scraper that collects product prices from 3 e-commerce sites.
- Code is clean and well-organized
- Added rate limiting and retry logic without being asked (impressive!)
- Documentation is thorough — includes setup instructions and example output
- One issue: the scraper breaks if a site changes its HTML structure (no error recovery)
- She went above and beyond by adding a price comparison feature
- Active in class discussions, helps other students debug their projects
- This is her strongest submission so far
