# Student Profile: Zara Khan
## Assignment: Module 3 — Recipe Finder App

## Observations

Created an app that finds recipes based on ingredients you have.
- Clever approach: uses fuzzy matching so "tomatos" still finds "tomatoes"
- Clean UI with good mobile responsiveness
- Proper error handling for API failures (shows user-friendly messages)
- Well-documented with screenshots in the README
- Only concern: heavy reliance on a single API — if it goes down, the entire app fails
- First-time student in our program, coming from a non-technical background
- This submission shows remarkable progress for someone who started 3 months ago
