# Student Profile: Bilal Hussain
## Assignment: Module 3 — Chat Application

## Observations

Built a real-time chat app using WebSockets.
- The core functionality works — messages send and receive in real time
- Tried to add file sharing but it's half-implemented (sends but doesn't receive properly)
- No tests at all
- Documentation is a README with just "Chat App" and installation instructions
- Creative feature ideas but execution is rushed
- Class participation is low — doesn't ask questions or engage in discussions
- Had a strong Module 1 but has been trending downward
