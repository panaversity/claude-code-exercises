# Student Profile: Omar Sheikh
## Assignment: Module 3 — Weather Dashboard

## Observations

Built a weather dashboard that pulls from the OpenWeather API.
- The UI looks great — clearly spent time on the visual design
- API integration works but ONLY for the 5 cities he hardcoded — no user input
- No error handling for network failures or API rate limits
- Documentation exists but is sparse — no setup instructions
- Submitted 2 days late
- He mentioned in class that he struggled with the API authentication part
- Quality has been inconsistent: Module 1 was excellent, Module 2 was barely passing
