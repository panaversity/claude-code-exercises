# Student Profile: Fatima Malik
## Assignment: Module 3 — Task Management API

## Observations

Created a REST API for task management with full CRUD operations.
- Endpoints are well-designed and follow REST conventions
- Added authentication (JWT tokens) — this was bonus work, not required
- Comprehensive test suite with 15 test cases
- Code comments are excessive — almost every line has a comment (some are obvious)
- Missing: no pagination for list endpoints (will be a problem at scale)
- She asks very thoughtful questions in class
- Consistently strong performer across all modules
