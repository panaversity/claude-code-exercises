Client Kickoff: CloudSync SaaS Project — Feb 14, 2025, 11:00 AM
Attendees: Ali (our PM), Ahmed (our design lead), Zara (CloudSync CEO), Naveed (CloudSync CTO)

ali introduced the team and outlined the project scope: brand identity redesign + marketing website + dashboard UI

zara explained what they want: "we've outgrown our startup look. we're going after enterprise customers now and our brand needs to reflect that. think professional but not boring."

naveed added technical requirements: website must be fast (under 2 second load time), mobile-first, and integrate with their existing analytics. they use Google Analytics and Mixpanel.

ahmed asked about brand direction. zara said she likes the Stripe and Linear aesthetics — clean, modern, confident. she specifically DOESN'T want the generic "blue gradient SaaS look."

ali proposed a 3-phase approach:
phase 1 (4 weeks): brand identity — logo, colors, typography, brand guidelines doc
phase 2 (6 weeks): marketing website — design + development
phase 3 (4 weeks): dashboard UI refresh — apply new brand to their existing product

zara approved the phasing. total timeline: 14 weeks, targeting completion by end of may.

budget discussion: total project is $7,500. payment terms: 30% upfront ($2,250), 30% after phase 1, 40% on completion. naveed asked if they could do monthly payments instead. ali said he'd check with finance and confirm by monday.

naveed asked about hosting. ali said that's outside our scope but we can recommend options. ahmed suggested Vercel for the marketing site.

zara's one non-negotiable: "I want to be involved in every design review. I don't want surprises." ali assured her they'd have weekly check-ins and she'd approve every major deliverable.

next steps:
- ali sends SOW by monday feb 17
- ahmed sends brand questionnaire to zara by feb 17
- zara sends competitor examples she likes/dislikes by feb 18
- first brand concepts review: feb 28
