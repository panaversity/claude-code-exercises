Hiring Sync — Feb 13, 2025, 10:00 AM
people: Ali, Omar (HR), Sara

discussing the 2 open engineering positions

sara: we need a senior backend dev and a frontend person. the backend role is more urgent — we're bottlenecked on API work

omar: we've gotten 45 applications for backend, 28 for frontend. i've screened them down to 8 backend and 5 frontend candidates for technical interviews

ali: timeline? we need someone by end of march ideally

omar: if we do interviews next week, we could have offers out by feb 28. factoring in notice periods, earliest start would be mid-march for backend, maybe late march for frontend

sara: can I see the backend shortlist today? I want to prioritize the ones with distributed systems experience

omar: i'll share it by EOD

discussion about whether to use a take-home test or live coding interview. sara prefers live coding because it's faster and you can see how people think. omar worried about candidate experience. they compromised: 30-min live coding + 30-min system design discussion

ali mentioned budget: approved for up to 120K for the senior backend role. frontend budget is 90K. omar said that's competitive for the market

omar will schedule backend interviews for feb 18-20. frontend interviews the following week.

sara asked about intern positions for summer. ali said to table that for the march planning session.

Meeting ended 10:35 AM. Next sync: Feb 20 (after first round of interviews).
