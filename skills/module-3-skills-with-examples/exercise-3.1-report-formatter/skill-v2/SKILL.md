# Monthly Performance Report — January 2025

## Executive Summary
Revenue grew 8.2% month-over-month to $52,300, driven primarily by a 15% increase in mobile conversions following our payment system overhaul. Customer satisfaction reached 4.3/5, the highest score in six months.

## Key Metrics
| Metric | January | December | Change |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Revenue | $52,300 | $48,300 | ↑ 8.2% |
| Active Users | 15,200 | 14,100 | ↑ 7.8% |
| New Signups | 425 | 362 | ↑ 17.4% |
| Churn Rate | 2.1% | 2.6% | ↓ 0.5pp |
| CSAT Score | 4.3/5 | 4.0/5 | ↑ 0.3 |

## Highlights
1. **Mobile payment overhaul shipped** — Conversion rate jumped 15% in the first week, directly adding ~$4,000 in monthly revenue.
2. **Organic traffic surge** — Blog post on AI tools drove 3,200 unique visitors, our highest single-content performance ever.
3. **Support response time cut by 25%** — New ticketing workflow reduced average response from 5.1 to 3.8 hours.

## Challenges
1. **East region underperformance** — Revenue flat while other regions grew 10%+. Root cause: two lost enterprise accounts due to delivery delays.
2. **API stability** — Three incidents in January totaling 47 minutes of downtime. All related to database connection pooling under load.
3. **Hiring pipeline slow** — 2 of 4 open positions unfilled after 6 weeks. Recruiting needs budget for sponsored job postings.

## Recommendations
1. **Investigate East region delivery process** — Assign ops lead to audit the fulfillment pipeline by Feb 14. Target: identify top 3 bottlenecks.
2. **Implement database connection pooling fix** — Engineering to deploy by Feb 7. This addresses all three January incidents.
3. **Increase recruiting budget by $2,000/month** — Enable sponsored postings on LinkedIn and Indeed for the two senior positions.

## Outlook
February is expected to sustain the growth trajectory, with the new onboarding flow (launching Feb 10) projected to improve activation rates by 10-15%. The East region situation requires immediate attention to prevent further account losses.
