# Exercise 6.3 — The Event Planner

## What You Have
A detailed event brief. Your job is to turn it into a complete planning package.

## Your Task
Ask Claude to produce:
1. **Timeline** — Backward plan from event date with milestones
2. **Budget spreadsheet** — Itemized with totals and contingency
3. **Master checklist** — All tasks by category
4. **Communications** — Draft invitation, reminder, and follow-up survey
5. **Day-of schedule** — Detailed run sheet
6. **Contingency plan** — 5 "what if" scenarios with backup plans

## The Twist
After everything is generated, tell Claude: "The budget just got cut by 30%. What changes do you recommend?" See how it adapts.
