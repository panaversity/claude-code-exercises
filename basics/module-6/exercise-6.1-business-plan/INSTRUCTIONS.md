# Exercise 6.1 — The Business Plan Skeleton

## What You Have
Three business idea briefs. Pick one (or use your own idea).

## Your Task
Have a CONVERSATION with Claude (not a single prompt) to build:
1. A one-page business concept document
2. A basic financial projection spreadsheet
3. A competitor analysis table
4. An action plan with milestones

## The Process
- Start with the idea brief
- Ask Claude to identify what questions YOU should be answering
- Work through each section interactively
- Challenge Claude's assumptions
- Ask "what am I not thinking about?"

## This exercise is about the CONVERSATION, not the output.
