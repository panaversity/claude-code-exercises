# Problem B: Online Course Engagement is Declining

## The Situation
You run an online course platform with 500 enrolled students. Over the past 2 months, the average course completion rate has dropped from 68% to 41%. Student feedback scores have also decreased.

## What You Know
- You launched 3 new courses in the past month
- The existing courses haven't changed
- Average video watch time has dropped from 85% to 52%
- Forum participation is down 60%
- You increased prices by 15% two months ago
- You switched from weekly live Q&A sessions to bi-weekly
- Two popular instructors left and were replaced
- You moved from one video platform to another (for cost savings)
- Students are complaining about "video buffering" in feedback
- Completion rates for the 3 new courses are 25% (vs 50%+ for older courses)

## What You DON'T Know
- Whether video quality changed with the platform switch
- If the new instructors are as engaging as the ones they replaced
- Whether the price increase changed the student demographic
- If competing courses have launched recently
- Whether students are using AI tools instead of watching videos
