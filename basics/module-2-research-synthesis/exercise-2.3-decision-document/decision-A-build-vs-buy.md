# Decision A: Build vs. Buy a Customer Dashboard

## The Situation
Your SaaS company (50 employees, 500 customers) needs a customer-facing analytics dashboard. Customers have been requesting this for 6 months and two enterprise deals are on hold until it exists.

## Option 1: Build In-House
- Your engineering team (8 developers) would build it
- Estimated timeline: 3-4 months
- Full control over features and design
- Ongoing maintenance burden

## Option 2: Integrate a Third-Party Tool
- Tools like Metabase, Preset, or Sigma Computing
- Can be embedded in your product
- Live within 2-4 weeks
- Monthly licensing cost ($500-$2000/month)
- Less customization

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use a third-party tool for v1 to ship fast
- Build custom solution for v2 over the next year
- Higher total cost but faster time to market

## Stakeholder Perspectives
- **CEO:** "We're losing deals. Speed matters most."
- **CTO:** "Technical debt from quick fixes haunts us every time."
- **Head of Sales:** "I need something to demo by end of month."
- **Head of Product:** "Our differentiation is in the analytics experience."
