# Topic C: Sleep and Cognitive Performance

## Background
Sleep research has exploded in recent years. We now know far more about how sleep affects memory, decision-making, creativity, and emotional regulation. Yet most knowledge workers consistently undervalue sleep.

## Angles to Explore
- How does sleep deprivation specifically affect different cognitive functions?
- What does the research say about naps and cognitive recovery?
- How do screen habits before bed affect sleep quality?
- What's the evidence for the "8 hours" recommendation?
- How does sleep quality differ from sleep quantity in its effects?

## Interesting Tensions
- "I perform fine on 6 hours" vs. what research shows
- Sleep medication vs. behavioral changes
- Individual variation vs. universal recommendations
