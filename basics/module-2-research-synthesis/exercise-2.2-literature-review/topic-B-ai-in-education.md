# Topic B: AI in Education

## Background
AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot have disrupted traditional education models. Schools and universities are split between banning AI tools and integrating them into curricula. The research on educational outcomes is still emerging.

## Angles to Explore
- What evidence exists that AI tools improve learning outcomes?
- What evidence suggests they can harm critical thinking or deep learning?
- How are different countries/institutions approaching AI in classrooms?
- What does "AI literacy" mean and why does it matter?
- How should assessment methods change in an AI-enabled world?

## Interesting Tensions
- Access equity (students with AI vs. without)
- Skill development (learning to use AI vs. learning fundamentals)
- Academic integrity in the age of AI
- Teacher role transformation
