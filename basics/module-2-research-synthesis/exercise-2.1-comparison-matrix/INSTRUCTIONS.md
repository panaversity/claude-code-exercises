# Exercise 2.1 — The Comparison Matrix

## What You Have
Three scenario files, each presenting a real decision with context. Pick the one that interests you most (or do all three for extra practice).

## Your Task
1. Read the scenario file to understand the context
2. Write a prompt that asks Claude to research and compare the options
3. Claude should produce:
   - A comparison spreadsheet (CSV or XLSX) with consistent criteria
   - A 1-page recommendation memo (markdown or Word doc)
   - A "decision matrix" that scores each option on your criteria

## Critical Skill
YOU must define the comparison criteria before Claude starts. The scenario files include suggested criteria, but you should customize them based on what matters most to you.
