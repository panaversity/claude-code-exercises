# Scenario A: Choosing a Project Management Tool

## Context
You're leading a team of 8 people at a small startup. Currently everyone uses a chaotic mix of spreadsheets, email threads, and sticky notes. You need a project management tool.

## Options to Compare
1. **Trello** — Visual kanban boards
2. **Asana** — Task and project tracking
3. **Notion** — All-in-one workspace
4. **Linear** — Built for software teams

## Your Constraints
- Budget: Max $15/user/month
- Team tech-savviness: Mixed (some very technical, some not)
- Key need: Visibility into who's working on what
- Integration: Must work with Slack and Google Workspace
- Timeline: Need to decide and migrate within 2 weeks

## Suggested Comparison Criteria (Customize These!)
- Price per user
- Learning curve (how fast can the least technical person learn it?)
- Mobile app quality
- Integrations available
- Free tier limitations
- Reporting/dashboard features
- Scalability (what if team grows to 25?)
