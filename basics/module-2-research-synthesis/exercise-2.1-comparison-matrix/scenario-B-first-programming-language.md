# Scenario B: Choosing a First Programming Language to Learn

## Context
You're a business professional with no coding background. You want to learn programming to automate parts of your job and better communicate with developers. You have about 5 hours per week to dedicate to learning.

## Options to Compare
1. **Python** — General purpose, strong in data/AI

4. **SQL** — Database query language, very practical for business

## Your Constraints
- Available time: 5 hours/week
- Goal: Be productive within 3 months
- Primary use cases: Data analysis, simple automations, understanding code reviews
- Learning style: Prefer hands-on projects over theory
- Budget for courses: Up to $50/month

## Suggested Comparison Criteria (Customize These!)
- Time to first useful project
- Job market demand
- Quality of free learning resources
- Relevance to AI/automation
- Community support for beginners
