# Exercise 2.2 — The Literature Review

## What You Have
Three topic briefs with background context and specific angles to explore. Pick one.

## Your Task (Two Rounds)

### Round 1 — Minimal Prompt
Give Claude just the topic and see what it produces:
> "Write a literature review about [topic]."

### Round 2 — Refined Prompt
Now specify:
- Target audience (college student? expert? general public?)
- Desired depth and length
- Specific angles from the topic brief
- Required structure (themes, not source-by-source)
- Output format (markdown doc? Word doc?)

## Compare Round 1 vs Round 2. What improved?
