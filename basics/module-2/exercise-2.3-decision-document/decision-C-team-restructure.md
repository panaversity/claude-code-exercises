# Decision C: Restructuring a Growing Team

## The Situation
Your team of 12 people has grown from 4 in the last 18 months. What worked with 4 people (flat structure, everyone talks to everyone) is breaking down. Meetings are unproductive, responsibilities overlap, and some things fall through the cracks.

## Option 1: Functional Teams
- Split into 3 teams by function: Engineering, Design, Product
- Each team has a lead who reports to you
- Clear ownership but potential silos

## Option 2: Cross-Functional Squads
- Split into 2-3 squads, each with engineers + designer + product person
- Each squad owns a product area end-to-end
- Better collaboration but harder to maintain consistency

## Option 3: Keep Flat, Add Process
- Don't restructure, instead add better processes
- Weekly planning, clearer task ownership, async updates
- Least disruptive but might not solve the root problem

## Current Pain Points
- Two engineers accidentally worked on the same feature for a week
- Design reviews keep getting postponed because "everyone needs to be there"
- Junior team members say they don't know who to go to for help
- Ship velocity has dropped 30% compared to 6 months ago despite more people
