# Decision B: Career Pivot into AI/ML

## The Situation
You're a senior web developer (7 years experience, $95K salary) considering a pivot into AI/ML engineering. You've done some online courses and built a few small projects but have no professional AI experience.

## Option 1: Full Career Pause
- Quit your job, enroll in a 6-month intensive bootcamp/program
- Cost: ~$15,000 + 6 months of lost salary
- Full immersion, fastest learning
- Risk: What if AI hiring slows down?

## Option 2: Gradual Transition
- Keep current job, study 10-15 hours/week
- Seek AI-adjacent projects at current company
- Timeline: 12-18 months to transition-ready
- Lower risk but slower

## Option 3: AI-Adjacent Role
- Move into a role that bridges web dev and AI (e.g., building AI-powered products)
- Leverage existing web skills while learning AI on the job
- May not get deep ML experience

## Constraints
- You have $30,000 in savings
- Monthly obligations: $2,500 (rent, loans, etc.)
- Partner is supportive but nervous about financial risk
- You live in a mid-sized city (some AI jobs, not a tech hub)
