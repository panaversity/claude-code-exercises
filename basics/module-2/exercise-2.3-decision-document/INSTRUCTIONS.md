# Exercise 2.3 — The Decision Document

## What You Have
Three decision scenarios with context, constraints, and stakeholder perspectives. Pick one.

## Your Task
Ask Claude to create a structured decision document containing:
1. Decision statement (the question being answered)
2. Context and background
3. Assumptions and constraints
4. 2-3 options analyzed with evidence
5. Risk assessment for each option
6. Recommended path forward
7. Next steps with owners and deadlines

Save as a polished Word document or PDF.

## Key Skill
The quality of the decision document depends entirely on how well you frame the decision. "Should we do X?" is a bad decision question. "Given constraints A, B, and C, which approach to X maximizes Y while minimizing Z?" is a good one.
