# Exercise 1.2 — Photo Album Builder

## What You Have
The `photos/` folder contains 24 SVG images — a mix of landscape and portrait orientations, with some duplicates/near-duplicates mixed in.

## Your Task
Ask Claude to:
1. Sort images by orientation (portrait vs landscape) into subfolders
2. Identify and flag potential duplicates
3. Create a simple HTML gallery page that displays all images as thumbnails
4. Generate a summary report of what was found

## The Two-Approach Challenge
Write your instructions TWO different ways:

**Approach A — Outcome-focused:**
> "I want a photo gallery organized by orientation with duplicates flagged."

**Approach B — Step-by-step:**
Give Claude explicit sequential instructions for each sub-task.

## Compare the results. Which approach gave you better output? Why?
