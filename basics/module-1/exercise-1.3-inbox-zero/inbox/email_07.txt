Hey! I'm working on the client presentation for Friday and struggling with the data visualization section. You're so much better at charts than I am. Could you take a look at slides 8-12 sometime this week? The deck is in the shared Google Drive folder. No rush — anytime before Thursday EOD would be great. Thanks!
