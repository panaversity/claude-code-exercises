Hi team,

We tested the beta release over the weekend. Overall very impressed with the improvements! A few items:

1. The dashboard loads 3x faster — great job!
2. Export to PDF is broken — gets stuck at 90%
3. The new filter feature works perfectly
4. Mobile layout has some alignment issues on iPad

Can we get items 2 and 4 fixed before the March 1 launch? Happy to hop on a call to discuss.

Best,
Zara
