# Exercise 1.1 — The Messy Downloads Folder

## What You Have
The `messy-downloads/` folder contains 35 files of mixed types — PDFs, images, Word docs, spreadsheets, text files, CSVs, and archives. Names are inconsistent, there are duplicates, and nothing is organized.

## Your Task
Point Claude Code or Cowork at this folder and write a prompt that organizes everything into a logical structure.

## Try This Progression

### Attempt 1 — The Vague Prompt
> "Organize these files."

Run this and note what Claude does. Then ask yourself:
- Did it organize by file type? By topic? By date?
- Is this what you wanted?

### Attempt 2 — Your Improved Prompt
Now write a better prompt. Consider specifying:
- What folder structure you want (by type? by project? by date?)
- How to handle duplicates (keep newest? keep all in a subfolder?)
- A naming convention (lowercase? hyphens? dates first?)
- What to do with empty or unknown files
- Whether you want a summary of changes

### Attempt 3 — The Professional Prompt
Write the prompt you'd give to a new team member on their first day.

## Reflection
- How many attempts did it take to get the result you wanted?
- What assumptions did Claude make that you didn't specify?
- Save your final prompt — it's a reusable "digital cleanup" specification.
