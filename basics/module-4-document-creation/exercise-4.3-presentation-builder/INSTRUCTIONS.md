# Exercise 4.3 — The Presentation Builder

## What You Have
`written_report.md` — a 2-page report on "The State of AI in Small Business: 2025 Outlook"

## Your Task
Ask Claude to create a PowerPoint presentation that:
1. Distills the report into 8-12 slides
2. Has a clear narrative arc (not just copy-pasting paragraphs onto slides)
3. Includes speaker notes for each slide
4. Uses data points as visual elements (not buried in text)
5. Follows the principle: "If you can say it with a number, show the number BIG"

## The Meta-Exercise (Critical!)
After Claude creates the presentation:
1. Review it critically — What would you change?
2. Write specific feedback (not "make it better" but "Slide 5 has too much text, distill to 3 bullet points max")
3. Ask Claude to revise based on your feedback
4. Compare v1 and v2

## This exercise teaches the most important AI skill: iterative refinement through specific feedback.
