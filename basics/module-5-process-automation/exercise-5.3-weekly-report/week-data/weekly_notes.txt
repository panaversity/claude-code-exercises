Week of Feb 3-7, 2025 — Team Highlights & Blockers

HIGHLIGHTS:
- Authentication bug that was affecting 3% of users is now fixed! Sara knocked this 
  out in 2 days. Customer complaints have already dropped.
- Page load times improved from 2.3s to 1.8s after Sara's optimization work. Still 
  not at our 1.5s target but great progress.
- Fatima completed 3 of 5 user research interviews. Initial feedback on the new 
  features is very positive — users love the simplified dashboard.
- New signups up 15% week-over-week. Attribution suggests the blog post Ahmed 
  wrote about "AI for Small Business" is driving traffic.
- NPS score trending up for the third consecutive week.

BLOCKERS:
- Omar's board presentation is overdue. He's been pulled into the hiring process 
  and hasn't had time. Needs help or a deadline extension.
- Fatima's customer feedback report is also overdue — she deprioritized it for the 
  user research (probably the right call, but it needs to get done).
- Ali is blocked on the database migration planning — waiting for the vendor to 
  provide migration tooling documentation. Followed up twice, no response.
- Still haven't heard back from the security audit firm about scheduling.

TEAM MORALE:
Overall good. The team celebrated Sara's bug fix with a virtual high-five session. 
Ahmed feels stretched thin between design work and content creation — might need 
to revisit his workload in next sprint planning.

NEXT WEEK PRIORITIES:
1. Complete user research interviews (Fatima)
2. Finish landing page mockups (Ahmed)
3. Ship API documentation (Ali)
4. Board presentation — MUST be done by Wed (Omar)
5. Continue page load optimization (Sara)
