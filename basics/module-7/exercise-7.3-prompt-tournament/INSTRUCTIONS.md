# Exercise 7.3 — The Prompt Tournament

## Your Task
Pick any task from the previous exercises (we suggest Exercise 3.3 Budget Tracker or Exercise 4.1 Meeting Notes).

Write THREE different prompts to accomplish the SAME task:

### Approach 1: Minimal
The shortest prompt you think could work (1-2 sentences).

### Approach 2: Detailed
A comprehensive prompt with all specifications (could be a full paragraph or more).

### Approach 3: Conversational
Achieve the same result through a multi-turn conversation with Claude.

## Run all three and compare:
Create a comparison document with:
- The prompt/conversation used for each approach
- The output quality (rate 1-5)
- Time spent writing the prompt
- Time Claude spent executing
- What was better/worse about each

## What You'll Learn
There's no single "right" prompt style. Different tasks and different people benefit from different approaches.
