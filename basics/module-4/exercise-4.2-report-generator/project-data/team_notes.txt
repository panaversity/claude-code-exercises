Q1 2025 Team Notes & Observations

HIGHLIGHTS:
- West region continues to outperform. New sales manager (Amara) started in December 
  and has been crushing it. Her approach of in-person demos is working really well.
- Widget B gaining market traction in South region. Possible due to new packaging design
  that launched in November.
- Customer satisfaction scores up 12% overall vs Q4 2024.

CONCERNS:
- East region underperforming significantly. Lost two key accounts (TechNova and BlueShift)
  in January due to delivery delays from warehouse issues.
- Widget A returns are trending up, especially in East. Quality team investigating - 
  suspected batch issue from Supplier X.
- Competitor "MegaWidget" launched a cheaper alternative in February. Early signs of 
  price pressure in North region.

STRATEGIC NOTES:
- Q2 marketing budget increased by 15% (approved by VP on March 5)
- Planning Widget C launch for Q3 — prototypes in testing
- Need to address East region warehouse situation before it gets worse
- Consider loyalty program to counter MegaWidget pricing pressure

TEAM CHANGES:
- Hired 3 new sales reps (1 North, 2 East) in February
- Sara (South team lead) promoted to Regional Director
- Training program for new hires starts April 1
