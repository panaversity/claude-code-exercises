# Exercise 4.1 — The Meeting Notes Transformer

## What You Have
`raw_meeting_notes.txt` — messy, informal notes from a product launch planning meeting. Includes tangents, informal language, incomplete sentences, and action items buried in discussion.

## Your Task
Ask Claude to transform these notes into THREE different outputs:

### Output 1: Formal Meeting Minutes
- Proper header (date, attendees, purpose)
- Discussion organized by topic (not chronologically)
- Decisions clearly listed
- Professional tone

### Output 2: Action Items Tracker
A table or spreadsheet with columns:
- Owner | Action Item | Deadline | Status | Dependencies

### Output 3: Executive Summary Email
A 3-paragraph email suitable for someone who missed the meeting:
- What was discussed
- What was decided
- What happens next

## Consistency Check
All three outputs must reflect the same decisions and action items. The coffee machine mention should NOT appear in the executive summary.

## Save all three as separate files.
