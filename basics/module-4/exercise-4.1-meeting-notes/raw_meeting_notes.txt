Product Launch Planning - Feb 5 2025 - 2pm
ppl there: Ali (PM), Sara (eng lead), Ahmed (design), Fatima (marketing), Omar (sales)

ali kicked off - said we need to lock down launch date
sara said eng needs 3 more weeks minimum to fix the payment bug and the 
performance issues on mobile. she was pretty firm about this
ahmed jumped in - said design is ready, all assets done, just waiting on
final copy from fatima's team

fatima - marketing plan ready BUT she needs 2 weeks lead time before launch
to coordinate press outreach and social media campaign
"we can't just flip a switch, I need time to brief the journalists"

sidebar: omar mentioned that BigCorp client is threatening to walk if we 
don't launch by march 1. ali seemed stressed about this.

some debate about whether to do a soft launch first or go big
- sara wants soft launch (less risk)
- omar wants big launch (BigCorp is watching)
- ahmed suggested phased approach: soft launch march 1, big push march 15

everyone seemed to like ahmed's idea actually

oh also sara mentioned they need to hire 2 more backend devs
ali said budget is approved but HR is slow
fatima offered to help speed up recruiting through her linkedin network

random - someone brought up the office coffee machine is broken again lol
ali said he'd email facilities

decisions made:
- march 1 soft launch, march 15 full launch (pending sara confirming eng timeline)
- fatima to start press outreach feb 15
- ahmed to finalize all launch assets by feb 20

things ppl need to do:
sara - confirm march 1 is doable by friday feb 7
fatima - draft press release by feb 10
ahmed - share final asset list with fatima by feb 7  
omar - talk to BigCorp, reassure them about march timeline
ali - email HR about hiring, email facilities about coffee machine

meeting ran over by 15 min, sara had to leave for another call
next meeting: feb 12 same time

ali mentioned something about Q2 planning but we ran out of time
