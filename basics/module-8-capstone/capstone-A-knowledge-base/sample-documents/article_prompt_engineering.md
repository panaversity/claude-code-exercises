# From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

The field is evolving rapidly. "Prompt engineering" was the 2023 buzzword, but 2025 is about "context engineering" — the art of providing AI models with the right context to produce excellent outputs.

Key differences:
- Prompt engineering: Crafting the perfect question
- Context engineering: Curating the right background information, examples, and constraints

This matters because modern AI can handle much more context (200K+ tokens). The bottleneck is no longer "how to ask" but "what information to include."

Practical context engineering includes:
- System prompts with role definitions
- Few-shot examples of desired output
- Relevant documentation and data
- Explicit constraints and formatting requirements
