# The Rise of AI Agents in 2025

AI agents have moved from research demos to production tools. Unlike simple chatbots that respond to queries, agents can plan multi-step tasks, use tools, and work autonomously toward goals.

Key developments:
- Claude Code and similar tools let developers delegate entire features to AI
- Cowork brings agent capabilities to non-technical users
- The distinction between "using AI" and "working with AI" is becoming clear
- Enterprise adoption is accelerating, with 60% of Fortune 500 companies deploying agents

The most important skill is now "specification writing" — the ability to clearly describe what you want an agent to accomplish. This is essentially a new form of literacy.
