# Thread: Best AI Tools for Non-Developers (Saved)

Someone asked "what AI tools should non-technical people learn in 2025?"

Top recommendations:
1. Claude (via claude.ai or Cowork) - general purpose AI assistant
2. Notion AI - for organizing knowledge and projects
3. Canva AI - for design and visual content
4. Zapier + AI - for workflow automation
5. Otter.ai - for meeting transcription and summaries
6. Gamma - for AI-generated presentations

Key insight from the thread: Don't learn 10 tools. Master 2-3 that cover your main use cases. The tool matters less than the skill of working WITH the tool effectively.
