# Problem C: Team Meetings Are Unproductive

## The Situation
Your team of 12 people has 4 recurring weekly meetings. People consistently complain that meetings are a waste of time. Decisions don't get made, meetings run over, and the same topics come up week after week.

## What You Know
- Monday: All-hands (60 min, all 12 people) — usually runs 90 min
- Tuesday: Engineering standup (30 min, 6 engineers) — usually runs 45 min
- Wednesday: Product review (45 min, 8 people) — usually runs 60 min
- Friday: Retrospective (30 min, all 12 people) — often cancelled due to "nothing to discuss"
- Total: 4 hours/week scheduled, ~5.5 hours actual
- No consistent meeting agendas
- 3 of 12 people dominate discussion in most meetings
- Action items are discussed but rarely tracked
- Some people multitask (cameras off, doing other work)
- The team grew from 5 to 12 in the past year — meetings haven't changed

## What You DON'T Know
- Which meetings people find most/least valuable
- Whether the quiet people have ideas they're not sharing
- If some meetings could be replaced by async updates
- What the team would change if they could
