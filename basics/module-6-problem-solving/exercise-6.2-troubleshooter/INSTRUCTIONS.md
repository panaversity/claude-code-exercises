# Exercise 6.2 — The Troubleshooter

## What You Have
Three realistic problem scenarios. Pick one.

## Your Task
Ask Claude to create a structured problem-solving document:
1. Restate the problem clearly
2. List at least 5 possible root causes
3. For each cause, describe a diagnostic test (how would you verify it?)
4. Rank causes by likelihood AND by ease of testing
5. Create an investigation plan (cheapest/fastest tests first)
6. Save as a structured document

## Key Principle: Don't jump to solutions. Diagnose first.
