# Business Idea B: Neighborhood Meal Prep Delivery

## The Concept
A hyper-local meal prep delivery service. Home cooks in the neighborhood prepare meals, and you handle ordering, delivery, and quality control. Like a marketplace for home-cooked food.

## Target Market
Busy professionals and families in a specific neighborhood (3-mile radius).

## Initial Thoughts
- Start with 3-5 home cooks
- 10-15 meals per cook per day
- Price: $12-15 per meal (cooks get 65%, you get 35%)
- Delivery by bicycle courier
- Order by 8 PM, deliver by noon next day

## What You Haven't Figured Out Yet
- Food safety regulations and licensing
- Insurance requirements
- How to maintain quality consistency across cooks
- Technology platform (app? WhatsApp group? website?)
- How to handle allergies and dietary restrictions
