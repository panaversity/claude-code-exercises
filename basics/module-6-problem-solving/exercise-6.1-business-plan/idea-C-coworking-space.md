# Business Idea C: Niche Coworking Space

## The Concept
A coworking space specifically designed for AI/tech freelancers and small teams. Features include high-speed internet, GPU workstations available for rent, regular community events, and a mentorship network.

## Target Market
AI freelancers, small AI startups (1-5 people), remote workers at AI companies.

## Initial Thoughts
- Location: A mid-tier city with lower rent but growing tech scene
- Space: 3,000 sq ft, capacity for 30-40 members
- Pricing: $200/month for hot desk, $400/month for dedicated desk, $800/month for private office
- Differentiator: GPU workstations ($50/day rental) and AI-focused community

## What You Haven't Figured Out Yet
- Lease terms and upfront costs
- GPU hardware investment and maintenance
- Whether the niche is too narrow (enough customers?)
- Community programming (events, workshops, mentorship)
- Break-even timeline
