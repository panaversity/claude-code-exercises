# Exercise 7.1 — The Fact Checker

## Your Task
1. Ask Claude to write a 500-word article about ONE of these topics (pick the one you know most about):
   - "The History and Science of Sleep"
   - "How Electric Vehicles Work"
   - "The Economics of Remote Work"
   - "Introduction to Blockchain Technology"
   - "The Global Coffee Industry"

2. Read the article carefully and identify:
   - Claims that seem specific (numbers, dates, statistics)
   - Claims that seem vague or hedging
   - Anything that feels wrong or oversimplified

3. Research 5 specific claims to verify them. For each, note:
   - The claim Claude made
   - What you found when you checked
   - Whether it was accurate, inaccurate, or misleading

4. Create a fact-check report and ask Claude to correct the article.
