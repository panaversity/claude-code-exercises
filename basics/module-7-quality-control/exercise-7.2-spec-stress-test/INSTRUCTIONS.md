# Exercise 7.2 — The Specification Stress Test

## Your Task
1. Write a set of instructions for Claude to create a specific output. Choose one:
   - A folder structure for a new project with specific files in specific locations
   - A formatted report from the data in `test_data.csv`
   - A set of email templates for different scenarios

2. Run your instructions through Claude and get the output.

3. Now read your instructions as if you were a STRANGER. Mark every place that's ambiguous:
   - Words like "nice," "good," "proper," "appropriate" (what do these mean specifically?)
   - Missing details (what font? what order? what format?)
   - Assumptions you made but didn't state

4. Rewrite the instructions to eliminate ALL ambiguity.

5. Run the improved instructions and compare results.
