# Capstone C — The Course Material Generator

## Your Mission
Create a complete 5-lesson mini-course on: **"AI Tools for Everyday Productivity"**

Target audience: Working professionals with no technical background.

## Deliverables
Ask Claude to create ALL of the following:
1. **course-outline.md** — 5-lesson course with objectives, topics, and time estimates
2. **lesson-plans/** (5 files) — Detailed plan for each lesson with:
   - Learning objectives
   - Teaching flow (intro → demo → practice → recap)
   - Estimated time for each section
   - Materials needed
3. **worksheets/** (5 files) — Student exercise for each lesson
4. **quiz-with-answers.md** — 20 questions (mix of multiple choice and short answer) with answer key
5. **reading-list.md** — 10 recommended resources with 1-sentence summaries
6. **presentation.pptx** — Slide deck for Lesson 1 (the intro lesson)

## Quality Requirements
- Each lesson builds on the previous one (progressive difficulty)
- Worksheets should be hands-on (not just reading)
- Quiz covers all 5 lessons proportionally
- Everything should be immediately usable by an instructor
