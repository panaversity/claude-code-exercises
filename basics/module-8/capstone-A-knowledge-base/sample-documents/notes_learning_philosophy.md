# My Learning Philosophy Notes

Traditional education: Teacher explains → Student memorizes → Test
AI-native education: Student defines problem → AI generates solution → Student verifies and learns

The role of the student changes from "receiver of knowledge" to "director of AI."

Key skills for the AI era:
1. Problem decomposition — breaking vague goals into clear tasks
2. Specification writing — describing desired outcomes precisely
3. Quality verification — checking if AI output is correct
4. Iterative refinement — improving through feedback cycles

The goal is not to replace understanding with AI, but to accelerate the path to understanding.
