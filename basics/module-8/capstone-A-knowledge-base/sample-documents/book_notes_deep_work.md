# Book Notes: Deep Work by Cal Newport

Main thesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming rare AND valuable.

Key concepts:
- Deep work = cognitively demanding tasks requiring full concentration
- Shallow work = logistical, easily replicated, often done while distracted
- The Deep Work Hypothesis: ability to do deep work is the superpower of the 21st century

Practical strategies:
- Schedule deep work blocks (2-4 hours)
- Quit social media (or drastically limit)
- Embrace boredom — don't fill every moment
- Drain the shallows — batch and minimize shallow tasks

My thoughts: How does this apply in the AI era? Maybe AI handles the shallow work, freeing us for deep work. Or maybe AI makes deep work less necessary. Need to think about this more.
