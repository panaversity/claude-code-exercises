# Notes: Spec-Driven Development

Spec-driven development is the practice of writing detailed specifications before asking AI to generate code.

Why it matters:
- AI produces better output with clear specs
- Specs serve as documentation
- Easier to verify correctness against a spec
- Enables non-programmers to direct AI development

Key components of a good spec:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Input/output definitions
3. Edge cases and constraints
4. Success criteria
5. Non-functional requirements (performance, security)
