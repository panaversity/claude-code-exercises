# Capstone A — The Personal Knowledge Base

## What You Have
`sample-documents/` contains 8 documents: articles, book notes, saved threads, and personal notes on topics related to AI, productivity, learning, and work.

## Your Mission
Ask Claude to:
1. Read and categorize every document
2. Extract key insights from each
3. Create a searchable `index.md` — a master document with all insights organized by theme
4. Generate a `connections.md` — which documents relate to each other and how
5. Write a `knowledge-profile.md` — "Here's what the owner of these documents seems most interested in, and here are the gaps in their knowledge"
6. Create a `reading-list.md` — suggested topics or books to explore based on the gaps

## This capstone tests everything: file handling, synthesis, analysis, and document creation.
