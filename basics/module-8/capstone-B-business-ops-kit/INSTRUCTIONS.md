# Capstone B — Small Business Operations Kit

## Your Mission
Create a complete operational toolkit for a fictional small business: **"Pixel Perfect Design Studio"** — a 5-person graphic design agency.

## Business Context
- **Services:** Logo design, brand identity, social media graphics, website mockups
- **Team:** Founder (you), 2 senior designers, 1 junior designer, 1 admin/project manager
- **Pricing:** Logo design $500-$2000, Brand identity $3000-$8000, Social media package $800/month
- **Current clients:** 12 active clients, 3-5 new inquiries per month
- **Monthly revenue:** ~$25,000
- **Monthly expenses:** ~$18,000

## Deliverables
Ask Claude to create ALL of the following (each as a separate file):
1. **Invoice template** — With auto-calculations, your business details, payment terms
2. **Client tracker spreadsheet** — Name, project, status, deadline, payment status, total value
3. **Weekly metrics dashboard** — Revenue, active projects, utilization rate, pipeline value
4. **Email templates** (5 separate files):
   - New inquiry response
   - Project kickoff
   - Revision request handling
   - Invoice follow-up (overdue)
   - Project completion & testimonial request
5. **Monthly report template** — Revenue, expenses, profit, project summary, next month outlook
6. **Operations manual** — Team roles, project workflow, client communication standards, tool list

## Quality Bar
All files should be consistent in branding (use the business name, consistent styling) and should cross-reference each other where relevant.
