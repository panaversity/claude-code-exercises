# Problem Solving with Claude Code & Cowork

**Part of [claude-code-exercises](../README.md) — the basics/ pack**

Practice solving real-world problems using natural language with Claude Code and Cowork. All sample data is included — download and start immediately.

**Prerequisites**: Chapter 3, Lesson 4 (Hello World) for Modules 1-4. Lesson 5 (CLAUDE.md) for Modules 5-8.

## Recommended Minimum Path

Short on time? Complete Modules 1-3 (9 exercises) to build the core skill of turning messy problems into clear specifications:

- **Module 1**: File Organization (learn specification clarity through iterative prompting)
- **Module 2**: Research & Synthesis (learn to define criteria and structure research tasks)
- **Module 3**: Data Wrangling (learn to describe transformations and verify results)
